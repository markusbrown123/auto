# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines (bundled `command.md`, or fetch the latest from the source URL below)
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Read the bundled snapshot first: `command.md` in this skill's folder (vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines @ `434b7f9`, 2026-10-05). It contains all the rules and the output format.

For newer rules, fetch the raw file (use `curl -fsSL`, not a summarizing fetch, so no rule is dropped):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read the guidelines (bundled `command.md` or the source URL above)
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
